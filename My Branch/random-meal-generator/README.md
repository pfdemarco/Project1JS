# Random Meal Generator

## Description
A user inputs a desired country/region and is given a random meal from that region. Or, the user may choose to receive a random meal from anywhere in the world. WOW!

A user is given ingredients and directions for the meal, along with an image of the meal and a map of where it is from. The user may choose to remember the meal as a "favorite" which will be displayed on the home screen.

A user may also choose to be given a random cocktail to go along with their meal.

## User Story

As a foodie, I want a meal recommendation from a particular region so that I can prepare it for myself to eat!
